    "In this notebook we discuss some of the basic concepts used in AbiPy \n",
    "to automate ab-initio calculations. \n",
    "In particular we will focus on the following three objects: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * `Task`\n",
    "   * `Work`\n",
    "   * `Flow`\n",
    "   \n",
    "The `Task` represent the most *elementary step* of the automatic workflow. \n",
    "Roughly speaking, it corresponds to the execution of a single Abinit input file without multiple datasets.\n",
    "From the point of view of AbiPy, a calculation consists of a set of `Tasks` that are connected together \n",
    "by some sort of dependency. \n",
    "Each task has a list of files that are needed to start the calculation, \n",
    "and a list of files that are produced at the end of the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the input files needed by a `Task` must be provided by the user in the form of Abinit input variables \n",
    "(e.g. the crystalline structure, the pseudopotentials), other inputs may be produced by other tasks.\n",
    "When a `Task` **B** requires the output file `DEN` of another task **A**, \n",
    "we say that **B** depends on **A** through a `DEN` file, and we express this dependency with the dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "B_deps = {A: \"DEN\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify this point, let's take a standard KS band structure calculation as an example.\n",
    "In this case, we have an initial `ScfTask` that solves the KS equations self-consistently to produce a `DEN` file. \n",
    "The density is then used by a second `NscfTask` to compute a band structure on an arbitrary \n",
    "set of $k$-points.\n",
    "The `NscfTask` has thus a dependency on the first `ScfTask` in the sense that it cannot be executed until the `ScfTask` is completed, and the `DEN` file produced by the `ScfTask` is threfore required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have clarified the concept of `Task`, we can finally turn to `Works` and `Flow`.\n",
    "The `Work` can be seen as a list of `Tasks`, while the `Flow` is essentially a list of `Work` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "End-users will mainly interact with the `Flow` since this object provides an easy-to-use\n",
    "interface for performing common operations (launching jobs, checking the status of the `Tasks` etc). \n",
    "AbiPy provides several factory functions for typical first-principles calculations.\n",
    "This means that you do not need to understand all the technical details of  the python implementation.\n",
    "In many cases, indeed, we already provide some kind of `Work` or `Flow` that automates \n",
    "the calculation and you only need to provide the correct list of input files \n",
    "that obviously must be consistent with the kind Flow/Work you are using.\n",
    "In a nutshell you should not pass a list of inputs for performing a band structure calculation to a Work \n",
    "that is expected to compute phonons with DFPT!\n",
    "\n",
    "All the `Works` and the `Tasks` of a flow are created and executed inside the working directory (`workdir`) \n",
    "that is usually specified by the user during the creation of the `Flow` object.\n",
    "AbiPy created the workdir of the different Works/Tasks when the `Flow` is executed\n",
    "for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `Task` has an associated set of input variables that will be used to generate the \n",
    "Abinit input file and run the calculation. \n",
    "This input **must** be provided by the user during the creation of the `Task`.\n",
    "Fortunately, AbiPy provides an object named `AbinitInput` to facilitate the creation \n",
    "of such input. \n",
    "Once you have an `AbinitInput`, you can create the corresponding `Task` with the (pseudo) code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_task = Task(abinit_input_object)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Task` provides several methods for monitoring the status of the calculation and \n",
    "post-processing the results.\n",
    "Note that the concept of depenendency is not limited to files. All the Tasks in the \n",
    "flow are connected and can see each other. This allows programmers to implements python\n",
    "functions that will be invoked by the framework at run-time. For example, one can \n",
    "implement a Task that fetches the relaxed structure from a previous Task and \n",
    "use this configuration to start a DFPT calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next paragraph, we discuss how to construct a `Flow` for band-structure calculations\n",
    "with a high-level interface that only requires the specifications on the input files.\n",
    "This example allows us to discuss the most important methods of the `Flow`."

    "There's indeed a bug in the last step. The connections among the nodes are OK but we made\n",
    "a mistake while creating the `EPhTasks` with:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "ph_flow.register_eph_task(nscf_input.new_with_vars(ecut=ecut), ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "because we passed an input for a standard band structure calculation to something that is supposed\n",
    "to deal with E-PH interaction.\n",
    "This essentially to stress that the AbiPy `Flow`, *by design*, does not try to validate your input to make sure\n",
    "it is consistent with the workflow logic.\n",
    "This is done on purpose for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expert users should be able to customize/tune their input files and validating all the possible cases in python is not trivial\n",
    "- Only Abinit (and God) knows at run-time if your input file makes sense and we can't reimplement the same logic in python\n",
    "\n",
    "At this pont, you may wonder why we have so many different Abipy Tasks (`ScfTask`, `NscfTask`, `RelaxTask`, `PhononTask`, `EPHTask` ...) if there's no input validation when we create them...\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that we need all these subclasses to implement extra logic that is specific to that particular calculation. Abipy, indeed, is not just submitting jobs. It also monitors the evolution of the calculation\n",
    "and execute pre-defined code to fix run-time problems (and these problems are calculation specific).\n",
    "An example will help clarify this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restarting jobs is one of the typical problem encountered in ab-initio calculations\n",
    "and restarting a `RelaxTask` requires a different logic from e.g. restarting a `ScfTask`.\n",
    "In the case of a `ScfTask` we only need to use the output WFK (DEN) of the previous execution \n",
    "as input of the restarted job while a `RelaxTask` must also re-use the (unconverged) final structure \n",
    "of the previous job to be effective and avoid a possibly infinite loop.\n",
    "In a nutshell, when you are using a particular `Task/Work` class you are telling AbiPy how to handle possible\n",
    "problems at run-time and you are also specifying the actions that should be performed \n",
    "at the beginning/end of the execution."

    "inside a jupyter notebook is handy if you are dealing with small calculations that require few seconds or minutes. \n",
    "This approach, however, is unpractical when you have large flows or big calculations requiring hours or days, \n",

    "In this case, indeed, one would like to run the scheduler in a separate process in the backgroud \n",
    "so that the scheduler is not killed when the jupyter server is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the scheduler in a separate process, use the `abirun.py` script.\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    abirun.py flow_workdir COMMAND\n",
    "\n",
    "where `flow_workdir` is the directory containing the `Flow` \n",
    "(the directory with the pickle file) and `command` selects the operation to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    abirun.py /tmp/hello_bands status\n",
    "    \n",
    "checks the status of the `Flow` and print the results to screen while\n",
    "\n",
    "    nohup abirun.py /tmp/hello_bands scheduler > sched.log 2> sched.err &\n",
    "    \n",
    "starts the scheduler in the background redirecting the standard output to file `sched.log`\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "`nohup` is a standard Unix tool. The command make the scheduler immune \n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this notebook is already quite long and these details are best covered \n",
    "in a technical documentation.\n",
    "What should be stressed here is that the behaviour can be customized with two Yaml files.\n",
    "All the information related to your environment (Abinit buid, modules, resource managers, shell environment)\n",
    "are read from the `manager.yml` configuration file, that is usually located in the directory `~/.abinit/abipy/`\n",
    "The options for the python scheduler responsible for job submission are given in `scheduler.yml`.\n",

    "To summarize, we learned how to define python functions that can be used to generate many input files easily.\n",
    "We briefly discussed how to use these inputs to build a basic AbiPy flow without dependencies.\n",
    "More importantly, we showed that AbiPy provides several tools that can be used to inspect and analyze \n",
    "the results without having to pass necessarly through the creation and execution of the `Flow`.\n",
    "Last but not least, we discussed how to use `robots` to collect results from the output files and store \n",
    "them in pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "AbiPy users are **strongly recommended** to familiarize themself with this kind of interface before\n",
    "moving to more advanced features such as the flow execution that requires a good understanding of the python language.\n",
    "As a matter of fact, we decided to write AbiPy in python not for efficiency reasons (actually python \n",
    "is usually slower that Fortran/C) but because there are tons of libraries for scientific applications \n",
    "(numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, etc).\n",
    "If you learn to use these great libraries for your work you can really boost your productivity and save a lot of time."

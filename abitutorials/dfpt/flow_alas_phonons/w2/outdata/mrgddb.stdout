 Current number of bloks =    3
 Will read     1 blocks from the input DDB
 Now, current number of bloks =    4
 All DDBs have been read
 check the equality of blocks, and eventually merge
 merge block #    2 to block #    1
 merge block #    3 to block #    1
 merge block #    3 to block #    2
 merge block #    4 to block #    1
 merge block #    4 to block #    2
 merge block #    4 to block #    3
     3 blocks are merged; the new DDB will have      1 blocks.
 open the output database, write the preliminary information
 write the DDB
 Write bloc number   1
 Bloc number   2 was merged, so do not write it
 Bloc number   3 was merged, so do not write it
 Bloc number   4 was merged, so do not write it
